  <p>
    I'm an experienced business professional with 13+ years of an existing and proven track record. In those years I've worked for companies like Travelex, Xeptor IT Distribution and I'm currently working for IBM in a strategic sales role. <br>
    <br>Since working in the IT sector, I've most enjoyed working within the channel and I've found a passion in working closely with business partners and having the strategic conversations on how to jointly address market need. Through these
    actions I've gained an excellent understanding of channel business and the various types of channel partners.
    <br>
    <br>I also take pride in the transfer of knowledge, advising and enabling our teams throughout Europe to drive new business as an established expert in new business.
    <br>
    <br>In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my partner, going to the movies and browsing the web for music to add to my vynil collection.
